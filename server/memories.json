They dressed up like the Kratt Brothers and did some games where they did create tag, create their own creature power disks and 'Go Wild' which is like 'Go Fish'. They also went to his cousin Porter's house to see some real 'Wild Animals'. We finished the day with some yummy cupcakes and ice cream from Aunt Kelsey.",

        "description": "Puerto Vallarta Trip: Karen and I were blessed to go to Puerto Vallarta on a trip I earned at my Premier Pools job. We stayed at an all-inclusive resort in Nuevo Vallarta called Grand Velas Riviera Nayarit. The resort had 3 huge pools and pool-side service where you could just relax and have drinks and food brought to you all day. We did an excursion and saw the town but my dream is to go back one day and just hang out around that pool and drink some more virgin 'Mickey-mouse' drinks!",
